I am Nikita Donskov. I am interested in programming.
I know Batch, PascalABC.net programming languages, and
now I'm learning C programming language. I have a YouTube
channel, and I make videos about writing interesting programs.
Here, on my GitHub page I will publish repositories with
open-source code from my YouTube videos, and my other cool projects.
Enjoy!
